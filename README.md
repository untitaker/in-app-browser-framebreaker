I cobbled together some stackoverflow answers and github gists I found on the
internet out of personal curiosity. The result: A lot of the advice found
online is outdated, and since none of this is any sort of standard, the URL
schemes tried are a moving target.

This works as of 2020 with TikTok's and Instagram's in-app browsers.
